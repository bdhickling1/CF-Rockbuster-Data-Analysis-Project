This is an example of an SQL query with a common table expression and inner joins to return Average rental payment and average number of rentals by customer by country:

WITH total_revenue_country_cte (country, number_of_customers, number_of_movie_rentals, total_revenue) AS (		
	SELECT	
		F.country,
		COUNT(DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS number_of_customers,
		COUNT(DISTINCT B.rental_id) AS number_of_movie_rentals,
		SUM(A.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM payment A		
INNER JOIN rental B ON B.rental_id = A.rental_id		
INNER JOIN customer C ON C.customer_id = B.customer_id		
INNER JOIN address D ON D.address_id = C.address_id		
INNER JOIN city E ON E.city_id = D.city_id		
INNER JOIN country F ON F.country_id = E.country_id		
GROUP BY F.country		
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC		
),		
rentals_per_customer_cte (customer_id, country, number_of_movie_rentals) AS (		
	SELECT 	
	A.customer_id, 	
	E.country,	
	COUNT(DISTINCT A.rental_id) AS number_of_movie_rentals	
FROM rental	A	
INNER JOIN customer B ON B.customer_id = A.customer_id		
INNER JOIN address C ON C.address_id = B.address_id		
INNER JOIN city D ON D.city_id = C.city_id		
INNER JOIN country E ON E.country_id = D.country_id		
GROUP BY A.customer_id, E.country		
)		
		
SELECT 		
	A.country,	
	A.number_of_customers,	
	ROUND(A.total_revenue/A.number_of_customers,2) AS average_revenue_per_customer,	
	ROUND(AVG(B.number_of_movie_rentals),0) AS average_rentals_per_customer,	
	A.total_revenue	
FROM total_revenue_country_cte A		
INNER JOIN rentals_per_customer_cte B ON B.country = A.country		
GROUP BY A.country, number_of_customers, total_revenue		
ORDER BY A.total_revenue DESC;
