# CF-Rockbuster-Data-Analysis-Project
__This data analysis project, prepared as part of the data analytics course for CareerFoundry, uses fabricated data from Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a fictional movie rental company. It features the use of SQL (PostgreSQL).__

## Objective
In a theoretical situation, Rockbuster Stealth, with fictional brick and mortar stores around the world, is facing increasing competition from streaming services. In order to break into the online video rental market, key business intelligence questions must be answered by analyzing data on their current customer's behaviours and geographic locations.

## Data

The 3MB dataset can be found in the attached project sheet
